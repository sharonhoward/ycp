### about the transcriptions

The transcriptions have been slightly cleaned up but no significant editing/correction work has been carried out as yet. These were working transcriptions, are frequently inconsistent, and do not conform to formal editorial practices.

* [text in square brackets] are my own insertions 
* [1],[2], etc, are used where there was more than one set of depositions in the same cause
* **?** in the text means it was illegible (to me at the time...), except:
* **word?** or **?word** or **?word?** indicates uncertainty about my interpretation of a word
