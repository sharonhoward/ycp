(Gonna Party Like It's) 1999
==================

The first incarnation of the project - lists and transcriptions originally made in the summer of 1999 in the Borthwick Institute in York. 

They are included as a record of the project's origins and are not really recommended for re-use. 

(*Note:* These are the oldest surviving versions, not *quite* the original files, which were made using WordPerfect and migrated to Word .docs not long after finishing the research.)
